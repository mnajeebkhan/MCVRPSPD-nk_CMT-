# MCVRPSPD-nk_CMT
Data set for Multicompartment VRPSPD problem (Generated and Modified). The `nkXX` instances are randomly generated and the `CMT` instances are adapted from [1] and modified to the multiple-compartment setting.

Each instance represents a multi-vehicle, multi-compartment Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD). The file follows a TSPLIB-style text format and begins with a header specifying the instance name, number of nodes (`DIMENSION`, including the depot), number of vehicles (`VEHICLES`), number of products (`PRODUCTS`), and vehicle capacity per product (`CAPACITY`, given as a vector). Node coordinates are provided in the `NODE_COORD_SECTION`, where each node is identified by an index and associated with planar coordinates, and distances between nodes are computed using the specified `EDGE_WEIGHT_TYPE`. The `PICKUP_AND_DELIVERY_SECTION` defines service-related attributes for each node using the format `i e l H s d1 p1 d2 p2 … dP pP`, where `e` and `l` denote the earliest and latest service times, `H` is the planning horizon, and `s` is the service duration. For each product, `dk` and `pk` represent the delivery and pickup quantities, respectively. When a vehicle visits a node, deliveries are performed first, reducing the vehicle load, followed by pickups, increasing the load. Capacity constraints are enforced independently for each product (compartment), such that the load of every product remains non-negative and does not exceed its corresponding capacity throughout the route. The `DEPOT_SECTION` specifies the depot node(s); in this dataset, node 1 is the unique depot from which all vehicles start and to which they must return. The file terminates with the EOF marker.
